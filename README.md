# AutoCore

Autocore is a public open source library that can be used as the core for any automation project. The whole thought behind it is that anyone out there whether they're a startup, large company, or someone playing around for fun can utilize this library in their project. Once downloaded and included as a dependency you can download one of our beginning templates and start getting to work. 

Eventually we will have a complete guide for getting setup on this framework.

This framework is designed on top of the following core technolgies:
 - Java 
 - Maven
 - Selenium
 - TestNG
 
# AutoCore Commons

AutoCoreCommons is the dependency that is shared among all projects. It shares three parts which all share one common idea; The Core. The Core contains all logic that can be shared among any project that you may want to automate. From there it gets broken down into three core features:

- Commons
  - Web
  - Mobile
  - API
  

If you are familiar with Java or want to learn about Selenium Automation please download this project and help out! We can always improve :)

 - Happy Coding
